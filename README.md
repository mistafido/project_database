SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
Designing a software solution that can run on a Node.js server to meet the requirements outlined in the sketch idea involves creating a web application with a backend server using Node.js and a PostgreSQL database for data storage. Below is a high-level architectural design for this software:

1. Backend Development (Node.js):

•	Express.js: Use Express.js as the web application framework to handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints.
•	Database Integration: Connect to the PostgreSQL database using a suitable Node.js library, such as "pg-promise" or "Sequelize."

2. Database Design (PostgreSQL):

•	Tables: Create tables in the PostgreSQL database to store data for employees, projects, contractors, reports, and user permissions.
•	Schema: Design the schema to reflect the relationships between these tables.
•	Access Control: Implement database-level access control using PostgreSQL's built-in features or a custom solution.

3. User Authentication and Authorization:

•	Authentication: Implement user authentication using libraries like Passport.js or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions.
•	Authorization: Implement hierarchical access control based on roles (e.g., admin, manager, user) and permissions (read, write, edit).

4. Data Collection Phase (Frontend):

•	Web Forms: Develop web forms for data collection, which allow users to input text, upload files (images, PDFs, videos), and select from predefined categories (e.g., reports, projects).
•	File Upload: Implement file upload functionality using libraries like "multer" to handle file uploads.

5. Data Retrieval Phase (Frontend):

•	User Interfaces: Create user-friendly interfaces for different departments to retrieve data. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js).
•	Tables: Display retrieved data in tables with sorting and filtering options.

6. API Development (Backend):

•	RESTful API: Design and implement a RESTful API to handle data retrieval and manipulation requests.
•	Endpoint Security: Secure API endpoints to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.

7. Security:

•	Input Validation: Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
•	Session Management: Ensure secure session management for user authentication.
•	Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance:

•	Unit Testing: Write unit tests for critical components of the application.
•	Integration Testing: Perform integration testing to ensure all parts of the system work together as expected.
•	User Acceptance Testing: Involve end-users in testing to validate the system against their requirements.

9. Deployment:

•	Server Deployment: Deploy the Node.js application on a Node.js-compatible server environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
•	Database Deployment: Host the PostgreSQL database on a suitable database hosting service or on a dedicated server.
•	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and updates.

10. Documentation and Maintenance:

•	Comprehensive Documentation: Create user manuals, technical documentation, and system architecture diagrams.
•	Ongoing Maintenance: Establish a maintenance plan for monitoring, updates, and bug fixes.

11. User Training:

•	Conduct training sessions for end-users and administrators to ensure they can effectively use and manage the system.

12. Conclusion:

This software solution leverages the Node.js runtime environment, Express.js framework, PostgreSQL database, and modern frontend technologies to create a robust data management system that meets the specified requirements. The system can be further customized and scaled to accommodate the evolving needs of the organization.
